# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## The Task
This task involved writing a program to generate a secure password and display it on the webpage. This involved adding options to change the specifications of the password and an input to read and set length of the password. Overall this was to demonstrate my proficiency with javascript and using it to interact with the webpage.
